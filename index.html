				It is time to start working on something!!!

				<p>
				Hi, this is the founder of Beroach Studios. I have put in a lot of effort to find something interesting,
				novel but also enjoyable, to serve as an idea for our first game.
				</p>


				<p>
				As of today there TWO of them, both of which I'd like to lead towards release: first one is Beroach-themed,
				which will be a strategic 2D-competitive multiplayer game revolving around pleasant experience
				and quirkiest mechanics. The second idea, it turns out, was NOT mine, but I found it so fruitful, that I
				simply need to pursue it. That idea will be underwater themed, and probably an offline adventure-like game, though I
				must stress here: I really like multiplayer games!
				</p>


				<p>
				I'm here to simply create games that I will enjoy making and we all will enjoy playing... perhaps games that will allow
				for some remorable moments? We will see where it takes us, and from now, I will be posting new updates.
				I haven't yet begun composing anything, but these news should serve as an anchor to say: it's coming.
				</p>


				<p>
				So, release of... ? When ... ? The exact title and approximate release date will be posted here, likely around,
				but definitely before, the end of this month. The title will certainly contain "Beroach" and the game will be published
				on steam for both Windows and Linux.
				</p>

				<p>
				A part of these news is taken to carve a few values by which Beroach Studios will create their games:
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li> Equity for all fans and equality between all players </li>
					<li> Competitive fairness </li>
					<li> High respect for art </li>
					<li> Allowing self-expression for players </li>
					<li> You bought it, you own it - respect for SKG </li>
					<li> Treatment of toxic individuals within game communities </li>
					<li> Transparency </li>
					<li> Quality over quantity, i.e. meaningful game experience and not constant radical game changes </li>
				</ul>

				<p>
				In the future, if successful, Beroach Studios will be more than just a game studio. I, as the founder, am a
				programmer but also an individual. I value humanity and freedom. I will keep a controling role in the Beroach
				Studios and on behalf of it clearly speak up against infringements of privacy, which nowadays are excused as measures
				for security. There are ways for humanity to tend towards a greater future, better future, but so far we're seeing
				too much dust for my liking. I will, for example, support causes that promote Open Source and fight against,
				for example, those ridiculous subscription services, which do not even benefit the economy.
				</p>

				<p>
				By then, expect me, Julian Zielinski, to take on a public role and speak openly and face critique with humility.
				That's my promise. BUT that is a far-fetched hypothetical scenario where Beroach Studios had been successful and
				I could still have perceivable influence on what's happening in the world. Regardless, THIS is who's behind Beroach 
				Studios.
				</p>

				<p>
				If you'd like to contribute to the project, the offer from 1st May, below, ist still valid!
				Please E-mail us, we still need help.
				</p>

				<p>
				Cheers!!
